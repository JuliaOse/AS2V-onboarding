'''Quick sort algorithm is in place sorting
it uses divide and conquer technique
It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the array and partitioning 
the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or
greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted, and 
the process continues until the entire array is sorted.

        quicksort(arr, low, pivot_index - 1)
        quicksort(arr, pivot_index + 1, high)

def partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low - 1

    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] <= pivot:
